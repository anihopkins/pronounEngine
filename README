Purpose: This file implements a "Pronoun" class that inserts the correct
pronouns into strings marked for pronoun insertion.

Usage: To mark a string for pronoun insertion, use:
	~1 to indicate the location of a subject (He/She/They/Xe)
	~2 to indicate the location of an object (Him/Her/Them/Hir)
	~3 to indicate the location of a possessive adjective (His/Her/Their/
	Hir)
	~4 to indicate the location of a possessive pronoun (His/Hers/Theirs
	/Hirs)
	~5 to indicate the location of a reflexive pronoun (Himself/Herself/
	Themselves/Hirself).

Call Pronoun() to instantiate a new Pronoun object.

Call pronoun.set(subject, object, possessive, reflexive) (ie. she/her/hers/herself or
they/them/theirs/themselves, etc.) to set the correct pronouns for pronoun.

Call pronoun.insert(string) method with an appropriately marked string to insert
the correct pronouns into the string.
