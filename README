Purpose: This file implements a "Pronoun" class that inserts the correct
pronouns into strings marked for pronoun insertion.

Usage: To mark a string for pronoun insertion, use:
	~1 to indicate the location of a subject (He/She/They/Xe)
	~2 to indicate the location of an object (Him/Her/Them/Hir)
	~3 to indicate the location of a possessive adjective (His/Her/Their/
	Hir)
	~4 to indicate the location of a possessive pronoun (His/Hers/Theirs
	/Hirs)
	~5 to indicate the location of a reflexive pronoun (Himself/Herself/
	Themselves/Hirself).

Call Pronoun() to instantiate a new Pronoun object.

Call pronoun.set(subject, object, possessive, reflexive) (ie. she/her/hers/herself or
they/them/theirs/themselves, etc.) to set the correct pronouns for pronoun.

Call pronoun.insert(string) method with an appropriately marked string to insert
the correct pronouns into the string.

EXAMPLE CODE:

import pronouns

malePronoun = pronouns.Pronoun()
xePronoun = pronouns.Pronoun()

malePronoun.set("He", "Him", "His", "Himself")
xePronoun.set("Xe", "Hir", "Hirs", "Hirself")

markedString = "~1 is hungry. I gave ~2 a burger. ~3 dog ate the burger \
instead! ~1 was sad because that burger was ~4. ~1 decided to make a burger ~5."

maleString = malePronoun.insert(markedString)
xeString = xePronoun.insert(markedString)

print(maleString + "\n")
print(xeString)

RESULTS IN:
He is hungry. I gave him a burger. His dog ate the burger instead! He was sad
because that burger was his. He decided to make a burger himself.

Xe is hungry. I gave hir a burger. Hir dog ate the burger instead! Xe was sad
because that burger was hirs. Xe decided to make a burger hirself.
